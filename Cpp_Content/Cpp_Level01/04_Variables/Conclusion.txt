- What are variables?
  Variables are just containers to store data values.

- Data Types in C++

 // Case Sentitive.
	
 // Different data taypes of variables (defined with different keywords)

  1) Fundamentals(Primitive data-types):

    * Integral Type:
	int  --> Whole Number : 712
	char --> Single Character : 'A'

    * Floating Type:
	float --> Floating Point : 14.5
	double --> Floating Point : 14.587945 (bigger than float)

    * Boolean Type:
	bool --> True or False / 0 or 1

    * String Type:
	string --> Text : "Soufiane" / "ABCDEF"

    * Void Type:
	void --> Empty

    * Wide Character:
	wchar_t --> Unicode

  2) Derived(data-types)

    * Function
    * Array
    * Pointer
    * Reference

  3) User-Defined(data-types)
    * Class
    * Struct
    * Union
    * Enum
    * Type Def

- Declaring (Creating) Variables:

  *  type VariableName = value; (1)
  *  type Identifier = Literal; (2)

     ** Example: 
	* std::string MyName{"Soufiane"};
	* short MyAge{29};

- Identifiers:

  * All C++ variables must be identified with **Unique names**

  * The *IDENTIFIER* is also called name of the variable.

  * These unique names are called identifiers.

  * Identifiers can be short names (like x, y, i, a, b) or more descriptive (like MyFirstName, Sum, Total and Grades).

  ** Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

- Naming Rules:

  * The general "Rules" for naming variables are:
    ** Names can contain letters, digits and underscores.
    ** Names must begin with a letter or an underscore(_).
    ** Names are case sensitive(myVar, Myvar, MyVar are totally different variables).
    ** Names can't contain whitespace or special characters like(!, #, /, *, %, etc ...).
    ** Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int, char, string) can't be used as names.
