# Pointers
##What are pointers?

Pointers are data containers similar to variables but with a simple twist!

The twist is they instead of taking a value they take only an address

##The address of what?

The address of an already existed variable/array/struct...

Pointers must have the same data type as the thing they are pointing to.

###Example:

if a variable is type of int.

Pointers also has to be of type int.
